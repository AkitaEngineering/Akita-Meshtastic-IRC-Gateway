This site contains the official documentation for the **Akita Meshtastic IRC Gateway (AMIG)**, a Python application designed to bridge the gap between the traditional Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol and the decentralized, long-range Meshtastic network.

## What is it?

The gateway allows users connected via a standard IRC client to:

* Send and receive messages on the Meshtastic network.
* Interact with Meshtastic nodes (list nodes, get info, send DMs).
* Execute specific commands related to the gateway and the mesh.
* Chat with other IRC users connected to the same gateway instance.

## Getting Started

* **[User Guide &rarr;](usage/installation.md)**: Learn how to install and run the gateway.
* **[Commands &rarr;](commands.md)**: See the list of available IRC commands.

## Project Status

This project provides a functional base for bridging IRC and Meshtastic. While core features are implemented, it can be considered a starting point for further development and customization. Please report any issues or suggestions on the project's repository.

**Disclaimer:** This software is provided "as is". Use it at your own risk. Ensure you understand the implications of bridging networks and comply with any applicable regulations regarding radio transmissions. Ensure API keys and sensitive configuration are handled securely.
